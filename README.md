# stock-analysis-app
App to do stock analysis along with live news feed sentiment analysis

This structure provides a solid foundation for your stock analysis app. Here's a summary of what I've coded:

An MVC-like structure with separate directories for controllers, models, views, and services.
A central entry point (index.php) that handles routing.
A config file for storing API keys and other configuration.
A service class for interacting with the AlphaVantage API.
A controller to handle business logic.
Basic views for rendering the UI.
A simple JavaScript file for client-side interactions.

To get this running:

Set up a PHP environment (like LEMP).
Create the directory structure as shown.
Copy each file into its respective directory.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in config.php with your actual AlphaVantage API key.
Adjust the BASE_URL in config.php if necessary. Remember that this app is written with consderating nginx - use given nginx.conf as needed.
Access the app through your web server, typically at http://<ip_address>

This structure allows for easy expansion. You can add more controllers for different features, create additional service methods for new API endpoints, and expand the views as needed.
